FEEDBACK:
Crazy idea, I like it
Not sure if it follows HW policy, might need to check with teacher
Include visuals/design prototypes
“Photo facial recognition scanner to identify the accounts associated with people in real life even if they don't want to give it to you.”- This probably violates consent
What about user profile pictures and descriptions?
How would you deal with impersonators/alt accounts
Will there be any image uploading or posting like other social media platforms?
